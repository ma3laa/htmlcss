    Figure element and Hiding class:

    The figure element is a distinct section for image elements. They can include figcaption element to entitle a group of images in a figure element.
    Sometimes elements such as these are too large for a mobile viewport. Our example provides for a figure element to be displayed for tablets and desktops.
    In this example, we will use the "display:none;" style with the help of classes in CSS to hide items from certain viewports.

    ".mobile {
        display: none;
    }"

    One, Two, and Three Column Layouts:

    The mobile first strategy involves keeping the page simple. Sometimes this means leaving out content, such as two of the columns.
    We gradually add in content for tablets. Here we will use a two-column layout. 
    Desktops might have a three column layout. We will use one here.

    <div class="row>
	    <div class="column left desktop">
            <aside>This is the left column.</aside>
        </div>
        
	    <div class="column center">
            <article>This is the home page.<section></section></article>
        </div>

	    <div class="column right tablet">
            <aside>This is the right column.</aside>
        </div>
    </div>

    It is important to note that the website has a three-column layout in every viewport.
    However, in two of the viewports, columns are hidden from view as is done with the figure element.
    The same classes are reused to hide multiple elements.

    Import Style Sheets:

    The style.css is quite long now. Yet it does not have to be.
    We can break up the CSS rules into multiple files and import them into style.css.
    The "@import rule" must be placed at the top of the style.css page in order to fetch what was placed in the other pages.

    "@import url("mobilestyle.css")"
