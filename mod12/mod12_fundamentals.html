    Web Servers:

    There are many applications that provide web service.

    IIS - This is Microsoft's web server that comes with Windows.

    Apache - This is one of web server programs that receives the heaviest use.

    Nginx -(pronounced "engine x") This is becoming very popular since it is faster than Apache and natively supports extra features.


    While Apache and Nginx can run on Windows, it is primarily used on Linux or BSD.

    Can use local iis in Windows - I cba to do it since my Windows file explorer doesn't seem to want to find it.
