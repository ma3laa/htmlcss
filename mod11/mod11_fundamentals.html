    Forms:

    Forms allow nusers to input information for retrieval from the website.
    Input controls provide the means to enter text on the webpage.

    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">

    Some common input controls:
    button - This provides a button on a webpage.
    File - This allows a user to input a file of upload.
    radio - These make a list that allow for one option from it to be made.
    submit - This processes a webpage form.
    text - This gives a single line for text input.

    The "textarea" control provides a large box on a web page for the input of multiple lines of text.
    <textarea id="textarea" name="textarea" rows="10" cols="50"></textarea>

    The select control provides a drop-down list that provides users a choice.
    <select name="course"?
        <option>Adult</option>
        <option>Teen</option>
        <option>Child</option>
    </select>

    Label elements aare paired with input controls using their id values using the for attribute to provide labels for them.
    <label for="course">Course</label>

    The action attribute is used by form elements to perform an operation specified by it.
    Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts can interact with web pages to provide information using languages such as PHP.
    <form method="GET" action="getForm.php">

    The onclick attribute allows a button to take an action such as executing a JavaScript function.

    <input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit" onclick="calculate()">
   
    Javascript is a scripting language that is used to provde extra function to we sites. The execution takes place within the web browser, which is why  it is called a 
    client-side scripting language.

    JavaScript scripts can be on the web page internally or stored in an external location. Calls to internal or external scripts should be made within the head element.

    External:
        <script src="text/javascript">//code goes here</script>

    Internal:
        <script type="text/javascript">//code goes here</script>

    
    Like CSS, JavaScript uses C-style multi-line comments.
    /*This
        is
        Multiline*/
    
    Yet JavaScript also includes C-style single line comments:
    // This is single line!

    Variables are a programmatic way to store information and changes to it.
    They are created using the "var" declaration.

    var test = 0;

    semicolons must terminate EVERY LINE of JavaScript. (Whitespace does not count)

    The "document.GetElementById()" method allows JavaScript to obtain data from HTML elements according to an element's id.

    In the following example, the test variable is assigned the element by "something".

    test = document.getElementById("something").value;

    Functions allow for the developer to create a sequence of operations to perform within a single call.

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function calculate(){
            var test = 0;
            test = document.getElementById("something").value;
        }
    </script>

    <input type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit" onclick="calculate()">

    
    Math operations can be performed on variables and stored within them or other variables.

    test = test + 1;
    
    //The following also does the same thing

    test += 1;


    The "alert()" method provides the user a message in an alert box.
    
    alert("This is the value of test" + test);


    jQuery is a JavaScript library that provides prewritten functions that you can implement in your own projects.
