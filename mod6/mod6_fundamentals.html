    Responsive Design:
        Responsive design is the strategy of accounting for as many device types as possible throughout the development process.
        The Viewport is the webpage viewing area.
        The mobile-first strategy involves site design that prioritises the smallest viewports.

        Use your browser to locate its responsive design mode. This will allow you to test countless viewports.
        (For chrome - [three dots options] > more tools > developer mode > press ctrl + shift + m)

        Fixed layouts retain their look despite the viewport size. 
        Fluid layouts grow and shrink site content based on the size of the viewport.
        Flexible images use CSS rules in fluid layouts to resize.
