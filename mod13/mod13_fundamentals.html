    Data Types:

    Data does not simply exist without a certain form.
    Fundamental to programming languages, including JavaScript, is the notion of data types.

    Variables in JavaScript can store many data types. 
    Three of these data types include:
        - Numbers
        - Strings
        - Booleans
    
    When declaring variables in JavaScript, it is not necessary to declare the data type. 
    Instead, JavaScript is dynamically typed. You simply declare a variable and (perhaps) assign a value.
    This can be both a blessing and a curse.

    The feature allows data types to change in a variable for different situations. 
    Yet you must remain vigilant of the data type under each given circumstance.

    Numbers can represent both integers and floating-point numbers. That is (technically) because all Numbers are floating-point numbers in JavaScript.

    Depending on the situation, JavaScript can sometimes treat what you think is a Number as a String (and vice versa).

    Strings consist of text characters. String "math" typically consists of taking two strings and joining them together. This is called concatenation.
    When you try to add two numbers and, for some reason, they are next to each other, it is likely because they are being treated like strings.
    Understanding the relationships between data types will allow you to exploit the behaviour to your advantage.

    Booleans can either be true or false.

    true and false are keywords.

    You can assign variables the values of true or false, but you cannot name your variable true or false as these keywords are reserved to JavaScript.
    Keep in mind that if you assign to a variable "true" or "false" in quotation marks, it will be treated as a string.

    You can exert some control over the data types like this:

    var thisNumber = 25; //Number(lack of quotation marks)
    var thisString = "25"; //String(2 & 5 are characters)
    var thisBoolean = false; //Boolean (true or false)

    
    Global Methods:

    JavaScript comes equipped with its own methods. There are many of these methods, including those that simplify converting data types. Here are two useful examples:
    - parseInt() - This converts a string into an integer.
    - parseFloat - This converts a stirng into a floating-point.

    Keep in mind that the string should be numbers to work properly.


    Variables:

    Variables store data in memory for later use. They are called variables because their values may change.

    There are two ways to declare variables.

    The "third way" is declared like a variable, but the value cannot change and therefore is not a variable.

    var - This is the original way to declare variables in JavaScript.

    let - This is new and works to declare variables.

    const - While grouped with variables and declared in a similar way, these are used for constants. The value always stays the same.

    
    Conditional Statements:

    Conditional statements control program flow by requiring certain conditions to be met for execution. The condition which must be met is found in parentheses.
    The condition must evaluate as true.
    There are four types:
        - if
        - else
        - else if
        - switch case

    If statements use a condition found in parentheses to check whether the code within its braces should execute.
    
    if (true) {
        //This always works because the statement is true.
    }
