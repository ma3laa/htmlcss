    Responsive Design:
        The viewport meta element is used to deliver websites that are optimised to the client device.
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, inital-scale=1.0">

    Media Queries:
        Media queries allow different CSS styles on the same page based on the size of the viewport and 
        the media upon it is viewed.
        They are itilised with the media attribute within the linkk elements.

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" media="screen">
                                                           "print" 
                                                           "speech"
        
        Screen media typically include smartphones, tablets, and computer monitors.
        Print media is used for printing a webpage.
        Speech media is used for reading the page out loud using screen readers.

        Media queries can also be specified using the CSS files themselves instead.
        As pages become more complex, this method becomes preferred.

        @media (screen/speech/print) {

        }
    
        Media queries have numerous features that can specify behaviour changes based on the size (or orientation)
        of the screen or viewport.

        @media screen and (min-width:481px) {
            nav li { display: inline;}
        }

        max-device-height - Changes are made based on the pixel height of the screen
        min-device-height

        max-device-width - Changes are made based on the pixel width of the screen
        min-device-width

        max-height - Viewport height accounts for changes
