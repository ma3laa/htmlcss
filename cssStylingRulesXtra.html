    Review: Flexbox

    display: flex changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
    
    display: inline-flex allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
    
    justify-content is used to space items along the main axis.
    
    align-items is used to space items along the cross axis.
    
    flex-grow is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis.
    
    flex-shrink is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.
    
    flex-basis is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with flex-grow and/or flex-shrink.
    
    flex is used to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in one declaration.
    
    flex-wrap specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.
    
    align-content is used to space rows along the cross axis.
    
    flex-direction is used to specify the main and cross axes.
    
    flex-flow is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one declaration.
    
    Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by declaring display: flex or display: inline-flex for children of flex containers.
    
    
    GRIDS

    display: grid;

    grid-template-columns: 100px 50% 200px; //1st 2nd 3rd column width
    grid-template-rows: 40% 50% 50px; //1st 2nd 3rd row width
    grid-template: 40% 50% 50px / 100px 50% 200px; //does both rows and columns in that order l>r
    fractions | grid-template: 1fr 1fr 1fr / 3fr 50% 1fr; //fractions of the total space
    repeat | grid-template: repeat(3, 1fr) / 3fr 50% 1fr; //if theres 3 in a row or 2 you can repeat the saame ones with repeat, then amount of repetitions
    grid-template-area
    row-gap / column-gap / gap
    grid-row-start / grid-row-end

    Full definitions of grids below:

    grid-template-columns defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid
    grid-template-rows defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid
    grid-template is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows in one line
    row-gap puts blank space between the rows of the grid
    column-gap puts blank space between the columns of the grid
    gap is a shorthand for defining both row-gap and column-gap in one line
    grid-row-start and grid-row-end makes elements span certain rows of the grid
    grid-column-start and grid-column-end makes elements span certain columns of the grid
    grid-area is a shorthand for grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end, all in one line

    

    Justify Content:



    start — aligns the grid to the left side of the grid container
    end — aligns the grid to the right side of the grid container
    center — centers the grid horizontally in the grid container
    stretch — stretches the grid items to increase the size of the grid to expand horizontally across the container
    space-around — includes an equal amount of space on each side of a grid element, resulting in double the amount of space between elements as there is before the first and after the last element
    space-between — includes an equal amount of space between grid items and no space at either end
    space-evenly — places a



    Align content:


    start — aligns the grid to the top of the grid container
    end — aligns the grid to the bottom of the grid container
    center — centers the grid vertically in the grid container
    stretch — stretches the grid items to increase the size of the grid to expand vertically across the container
    space-around — includes an equal amount of space on each side of a grid element, resulting in double the amount of space between elements as there is before the first and after the last element
    space-between — includes an equal amount of space between grid items and no space at either end
    space-evenly — places an even amount of space between grid items and at either end



    Justify & Align "Self":

    justify-self specifies how an individual element should position itself with respect to the row axis. This property will override justify-items for any item on which it is declared.

    align-self specifies how an individual element should position itself with respect to the column axis. This property will override align-items for any item on which it is declared.



    Grid Auto Flow:


    In addition to setting the dimensions of implicitly-added rows and columns, we can specify the order in which they are rendered.

    grid-auto-flow specifies whether new elements should be added to rows or columns, and is declared on grid containers.

    grid-auto-flow accepts these values:

    row — specifies the new elements should fill rows from left to right and create new rows when there are too many elements (default)
    column — specifies the new elements should fill columns from top to bottom and create new columns when there are too many elements
    dense — this keyword invokes an algorithm that attempts to fill holes earlier in the grid layout if smaller elements are added
    You can pair row or column with dense, like this: grid-auto-flow: row dense;.





    Advanced Grid Review:


    grid-template-areas specifies grid named grid areas
    grid layouts are two-dimensional: they have a row, or inline, axis and a column, or block, axis.
    justify-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the row axis
    justify-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the row axis
    justify-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the row axis
    align-items specifies how individual elements should spread across the column axis
    align-content specifies how groups of elements should spread across the column axis
    align-self specifies how a single element should position itself with respect to the column axis
    grid-auto-rows specifies the height of rows added implicitly to the grid
    grid-auto-columns specifies the width of columns added implicitly to the grid
    grid-auto-flow specifies in which direction implicit elements should be created




    Scaling background images:

    body {
        background-image: url('#');
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-position: center;
        background-size: cover;
        }



    Content on a website can be sized relative to other elements on the page using relative measurements.
    The unit of em sizes font relative to the font size of a parent element.
    The unit of rem sizes font relative to the font size of a root element. That root element is the <html> element.
    Percentages are commonly used to size box-model features, like the width, height, padding, or margin of an element.
    When percentages are used to size width and height, child elements will be sized relative to the dimensions of their parent (remember that parent dimensions must first be set).
    Percentages can be used to set padding and margin. Horizontal and vertical padding and margin are set relative to the width of a parent element.
    The minimum and maximum width of elements can be set using min-width and max-width.
    The minimum and maximum height of elements can be set using min-height and max-height.
    When the height of an image or video is set, then its width can be set to auto so that the media scales proportionally. Reversing these two properties and values will also achieve the same result.
    A background image of an HTML element will scale proportionally when its background-size property is set to cover.



    the name="viewport" attribute: tells the browser to display the web page at the same width as its screen
    the content attribute: defines the values for the <meta> tag, including width and initial-scale
    the width=device-width key-value pair: controls the size of the viewport in which it sets the width of the viewport to equal the width of the device
    the initial-scale=1 key-value pair: sets the initial zoom level



    Media queries:

    
@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  .page-title {
    width: 270px;
  }
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 480px) {
  .gallery-item .thumbnail {
    width: 95%;
  }
}
