    Review: Flexbox

    display: flex changes an element to a block-level container with flex items inside of it.
    
    display: inline-flex allows multiple flex containers to appear inline with each other.
    
    justify-content is used to space items along the main axis.
    
    align-items is used to space items along the cross axis.
    
    flex-grow is used to specify how much space (and in what proportions) flex items absorb along the main axis.
    
    flex-shrink is used to specify how much flex items shrink and in what proportions along the main axis.
    
    flex-basis is used to specify the initial size of an element styled with flex-grow and/or flex-shrink.
    
    flex is used to specify flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis in one declaration.
    
    flex-wrap specifies that elements should shift along the cross axis if the flex container is not large enough.
    
    align-content is used to space rows along the cross axis.
    
    flex-direction is used to specify the main and cross axes.
    
    flex-flow is used to specify flex-wrap and flex-direction in one declaration.
    
    Flex containers can be nested inside of each other by declaring display: flex or display: inline-flex for children of flex containers.

    grid-template: 40% 50% 50px / 100px 50% 200px; //does both rows and columns in that order l>r
    fractions | grid-template: 1fr 1fr 1fr / 3fr 50% 1fr; //fractions of the total space
    repeat | grid-template: repeat(3, 1fr) / 3fr 50% 1fr; //if theres 3 in a row or 2 you can repeat the saame ones with repeat, then amount of repetitions

    Full definitions of grids below:

    grid-template-columns defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid
    grid-template-rows defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid
    grid-template is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows in one line
    row-gap puts blank space between the rows of the grid
    column-gap puts blank space between the columns of the grid
    gap is a shorthand for defining both row-gap and column-gap in one line
    grid-row-start and grid-row-end makes elements span certain rows of the grid
    grid-column-start and grid-column-end makes elements span certain columns of the grid
    grid-area is a shorthand for grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end, all in one line

    

    Justify Content:



    start — aligns the grid to the left side of the grid container
    end — aligns the grid to the right side of the grid container
    center — centers the grid horizontally in the grid container
    stretch — stretches the grid items to increase the size of the grid to expand horizontally across the container
    space-around — includes an equal amount of space on each side of a grid element, resulting in double the amount of space between elements as there is before the first and after the last element
    space-between — includes an equal amount of space between grid items and no space at either end
    space-evenly — places a
