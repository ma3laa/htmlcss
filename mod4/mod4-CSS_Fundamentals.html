<!-- 
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language for document formatting in a markup language.
    Styles are webpage appearance rules.
    Style sheets are sets of styles.

    Style Locations:

    Inline Styles are inserted into the tag of an element.
        <h1 style="font-color: red">Title</h1>
    
    Embedded(internal) style sheets are located within the heaad (<head>) element.
        Like inline styles, these work within the given webpage
    
    External (linked) style sheets are .css files that are linked to webpages.
        This has the benefit of using styles across entire websites.

    
    CSS Essentials:

    Selectors identify the elements to style.
        Headers, id selectors, class selectors, and descendant selectors can be used
        Declarations are included within selectors.
    
    Declarations are style formatting definitions
        These consist of properties and values.

    
    CSS Declarations:

    Declarations are found within selectors and consist of properties and values.

    Properties are the applied characteristic identifications, such as font-style. (font-style:italic)

    Values are what is entered to apply the desired characteristic, such as italic.
